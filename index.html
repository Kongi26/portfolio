         Standing as a bridge between writing for user experience  and storytelling, I mesh the elements of screenwriting with the elements of user experience writing to bring about a satisfactory, fulfilled and memorable experience each time users interact with my UI designs and UI text. As a UX Writer/Designer, having a background in screenwriting has afforded me a great leverage in understanding the needs of characters (users) because before I begin to write my stories, I walk in the shoes of my character and immerse myself in the sea of their needs, flaws, goals, motivations and pain points. As a screenwriter, I believe solely in the psychology of character research, for it is the cornerstone of any great screenplay; the same is true for writing for user experience. User Research is the foundation upon which great user experience design and writing is built. Writing user-centric copies and interfaces that sounds and relates like human is what makes me graciously unique.
